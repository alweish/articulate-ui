Articulate UI customized for BotSharp NLU

This project is tailored from [Articulate](https://github.com/samtecspg/articulate) to adapt [BotSharp NLU](https://github.com/Oceania2018/BotSharp), only keeps the UI folder and remove Rasa NLU related stuff. [Articulate](http://spg.ai/projects/articulate) is a platform for building conversational interfaces with intelligent agents (chatbots). [Rasa NLU](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu) (Natural Language Understanding) is a tool for understanding what is being said in short pieces of text. 

Thanks for Articulate open sourced its awesome project. Let BotSharp has the opportunity to integrate with Articulate to provide the best experience for the chatbot developers.
